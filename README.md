# AI (ChatGPT) Service on AWS with Bedrock, API gateway and Lambda

This work shows how to build an AI chat service on AWS using:
AWS Lambda
Amazon Bedrock
Amazon API Gateway

Basically, this is a ChatGPT-like service built on AWS.

## [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html)
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes it easy to use foundation models from third-party providers and Amazon.

## [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/?icmpid=docs_homepage_featuredsvcs)
With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there's no charge when your code isn't running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service—all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

Simply put, a serverless service that you use to compute your code without worrying about servers, you pay only when your code is running. Upload your code and see it run.

## [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/?icmpid=docs_homepage_networking).
Amazon API Gateway enables you to create and deploy your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. You can create robust, secure, and scalable APIs that access Amazon Web Services or other web services, as well as data that’s stored in the AWS Cloud. 

# Requirement
+ An AWS account with access to create and edit resources in the architecture.

The other tools used are:
+ VS Code 
* Postman

# Reference
Please check for the lambda function .py file which shows the command line
The model parameter chosen is for the Cohere Command model for model14 and Boto3

Check [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-cohere-command.html) to better get the Amazon Documentation for Cohere model used.

Enjoy!!
